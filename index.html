            About Me
            </h2>
            <p>
                I am a WITS student studying Pure Mathematics, Applied Mathematics and Computer Science.
                My hobbies are movies, books and gym. 
                Most recently I have become obsessed with the DUNE book series. I have currently read the first 3 of 6 books.
                It has been interesting to look at the differences present in the books and the movie adaptation.
